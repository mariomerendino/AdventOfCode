## Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for this years [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)

* Day 1 is written in Java
* Day 2 is written in Ruby
* Day 3-12 is written in Javascript
* Day 13 is written in ruby. I tried to do it in JS, but got frustrated. So I started over in Ruby. Turns out my JS solution would have probably worked, I just did not read the instructions to the problem. 
* Day 14 - 25 should be written in Javascript ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


* Was going to do some problems in TypeScript, I am lazy and didn't
